            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>

The Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:197439:3"/> whereof I have here set downe in these ensuing particulars:</p>
            <p>Upon Thursday last there was a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger came to the House of Commons informing them that <hi>Portsmouth</hi> was taken by Colonell <hi>Goring,</hi> hee most traiterously betraying the trust reposed in him by both Hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of Parliament, who having got a great summe of money from the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of that County, being divers Papists inhabiting therein, made it knowne to the Officers and Souldiers that lay in Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and so by that meanes won the hearts of divers of them, but a great part left the Towne; hee also made them acquainted with the command that he had received from his Majesty, which was to this effect, That He had sent to him to put the town of <hi>Portsmouth</hi> into such a posture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, he being Governour thereof that it might bee fit for the guard and safety of His Majesties person, and that His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse did expect to finde a place of trust in the said Towne; This is the summe
<pb facs="tcp:197439:3"/> and full scope of His Majesties Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, to the Governour of <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Goring,</hi> the said <hi>Goring</hi> being resolved to raise Fortifications and Bvlwarkes neere to the Towne for the safety of the same.</p>
            <p>Both Houses of Parliament having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the proceedings of Colonell <hi>Goring</hi> into consideration, and foreseeing the great danger that might ensue thereby, after some time of debate, resolved upon these instructions to be sent to <hi>Hampshire,</hi> and to <hi>Southampton,</hi> to this effect:</p>
            <p>That the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> (Lord Generall of the Army) for the defence of the King, Kingdome, and Parliament, shall forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with appoint Officers to levie Horse and Foot in those places, and march to <hi>Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> giving him command to those that shall oppose them in their passage, and that they shall also in the Name of the High Court of PARLIAMENT de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the said Towne of <hi>Portsmouth,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:197439:4"/> and the Castle, and command Colonell <hi>Groing</hi> Governour thereof to deliver up unto them, and to demand the said <hi>Goring,</hi> and to apprehend him as guilty of High Treason, and if he denyed to lay siedge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Towne, and to suppresse all that shall come to oppose them, and that they shall also require the aide and assistance of all the next adjacent Counties, in the name of all the Commons in <hi>England,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other directions concerning the said businesse; All which were carried up to the Lords, desiring their assent to them, that they may be forthwith put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. These are the instructions that are given to the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the peace of the Kingdome. The said Houses of Parliament having taken into serious consideration the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that may ensue by the revolt of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Goring,</hi> in the Ile of <hi>Wight</hi> the Earle of <hi>Portland</hi> Governour thereof being a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friend with the said <hi>Goring</hi> and his Mother a Papist; They out of their judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:197439:4"/> care and respect which they beare to the peace and welfare of this Kingdome, have thought it very necessary to displace the said Earle of <hi>Portland,</hi> and to repose the trust of the said Ile of <hi>Wight</hi> to the custody of the Right Honorable the Earle of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> which they have accordingly done, and hath given him command, that he shall see the same strongly fortified and guarded.</p>
            <p>The Honourable Court of Parliament, having for a long time sate with much paines taking for the safety of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the Malignant partie having got such a head, that they doe daily seeek the utter ruine and destruction of this Iland, and long since had prevailed and brought their plots and conspiracies to perfection had it not been for the Honourable Court of Parliament, to whom we are all bound to defend to the uttermost of our Lives and Fortunes; and they also taking into consideration the great disturbances that are now in severall Counties of this Realm
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:197439:5"/> there was a motion made in the House of Commons for adjourning the Parliament for 15. dayes, onely a grand Committee to be appointed to sit during that time, and the rest of the Members to goe to their severall places to settle the peace of the Countrey; which Motion was refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the grand Committee of both Houses appointed to consider for the safety of the Kingdome.</p>
